Project Overview Dive into the exhilarating realm of game development with my Pong Game project! ðŸš€ This project isn't just about recreating a timeless arcade game; it's a showcase of my growth as a developer, with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the art of using inherited classes.
Classic Pong Gameplay: Experience the nostalgia of the Pong arcade game, where players control paddles to bounce the ball and score points.
Interactive Multiplayer: Challenge a friend in two-player mode, enhancing the competitive spirit of the game.
Score Tracking: Keep track of scores for each player and determine the ultimate Pong champion.

Advanced OOP Techniques: I've employed advanced OOP concepts to create a modular structure for the game. Classes and inheritance were pivotal in maintaining a well-organized and extensible codebase.
Inherited Classes Mastery: The Pong Game project provided an excellent opportunity for me to grasp the power of inherited classes. I've elegantly extended classes to create distinct game elements while reusing common functionalities.
